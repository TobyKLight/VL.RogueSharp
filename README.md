# VL.RogueSharp
A vvvv gamma wrapper for the open source RogueSharp library by Faron Bracy

Original library and documentation https://github.com/FaronBracy/RogueSharp

Using this version of the library: nuget 5.0.0 pre2 https://www.nuget.org/packages/RogueSharp/5.0.0-pre2

//APPLICATION
RogueSharp has functions useful for reasoning about 2D grids where some cells are walkable or transaprent. 
For example pathfinding and field of view. 
Also includes a dice rolling function. 
Comes with a quick and dirty ASCII renderer of the maps using VL.Skia, it's expected most users would take the map data and plug it into their own prettier drawing system.

RoegueSharp is originally intended for game development of roguelikes.
